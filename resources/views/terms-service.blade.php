                        <h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is the Terms of Service agreement for Future Taikun, a platform operated by Future Taikun.
                            All users must read and accept every aspect of this and any other agreement or policy
                            provided by Future Taikun. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are prohibited from using

                        <h3>The Ground Rules</h3>
                        <p>
                            The success of Future Taikun thrives because of the quality of its members and some basic rules
                            that everyone adheres to. We reserve the right to deny service to any member or prospective
                            member at any time.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>No Misrepresentation:</strong> Please be as honest and forthright about yourself and
                                your offer as possible. Members are encouraged to report any communications that they
                                consider to be misleading or any members that appear to be misrepresenting themselves.</li>
                            <li><strong>No Leeches:</strong> A leech is someone who doesn’t respect the interests of the
                                community and attempts to abuse the system for their own benefit. They take constantly and
                                offer nothing in return. The Network succeeds because of our community’s ability to give.
                                Don’t be a leech.</li>
                        </ul>

                            By posting on this site, members represent and agree that nothing contained herein constitutes
                            an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy any security, and that if any offer or sale
                            of securities is deemed to have occurred by reason of a posting or listing on this site, such
                            offer and sale is made solely to institutional or accredited investors as those terms are
